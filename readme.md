# Vulkan

Haskell bindings to the Vulkan graphics API

## Building

This package requires GHC 8.0 or higher due to the use of the
`DuplicateRecordFields` and `Strict` language extensions.

## Current Status

All the core Vulkan functionality is here.

This is currently a 64 bit only library, 32 bit support is on the roadmap.
