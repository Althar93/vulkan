# Generate

This program generates the haskell source from the Vulkan xml specification. 

It's pretty gross at the moment having been hacked together in a couple of
evenings. The intention is to clean things up and make it available as a
package for people who want to do other cool things with the xml spec to use.

## TODO

Handle the "sections" in the spec. These are sets of declarations separated by
comments.
